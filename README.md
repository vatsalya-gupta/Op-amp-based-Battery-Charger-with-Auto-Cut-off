# Op-amp based Battery Charger Circuit with Auto Cut-off

The project proposes a two op-amp based auto cut off battery charger circuit which is not only accurate with its features but also allows a hassle free and quick setting up of its high/low cut-off threshold limits. The major objectives include:

1. To design a circuit which will automatically disconnect the battery and supply power to the system, when the circuit is connected to an external power source, in the meanwhile also charging the battery.
2. Overcharging protection for the battery.
3. Battery low and full charging indications.
